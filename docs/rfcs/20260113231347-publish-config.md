## Implementation Details
1.  **Security Check**: Analyzed `config` file. Found DeepL API Key present in 4 program definitions.
    *   **Decision**: Replaced the actual API key with a placeholder `YOUR_DEEPL_API_KEY` to prevent leakage.
2.  **Documentation**:
    *   Updated `README.md` with links to related projects.
    *   Created `release-notes.md`.
